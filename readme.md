hello world java webapp
=======================

this is a simple web app that can be used to for demo and testing purposes, e.g. for cloud
infrastructure, container management and/or a ci/cd pipeline.
it is a webapp that just returns some html that says "hello world"

* [Hello World](http://localhost:8080)
* [Hello Remi](http://localhost:8080?name=Remi)

this webapp is also available as a docker image:

https://hub.docker.com/r/remigius65/webapp-hello-java/

some usages can be found in the material to my [rancher workshop](https://github.com/Remigius2011/rancher-workshop).
